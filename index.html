            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p> Indian Customs-Import-Export:
            SnowFlake was utilised as the data warehousing solution to store and manage Indian customs import and export data. IICS employed for data transformations, ensuring seamless integration and data quality. Python was the chosen coding language for custom data processing and manipulation. Finally, Tableau was used to create interactive and insightful visualizations, allowing stakeholders to explore and analyze the import and export trends effectively. The project facilitated comprehensive data-driven decision-making and provided valuable insights into trade patterns and performance.
              <p>Data Ingestion Pipeline in AWS:
              A data ingestion pipeline was designed and implemented. The process began with uploading files to Amazon S3. Upon file upload, a Lambda function was triggered, connecting to a database where it inserted the record details. This data in the database was then automatically loaded into Amazon Redshift, creating a seamless and automated data ingestion flow. The pipeline ensured efficient data transfer, transformation, and storage, enabling easy access and analysis of the data in Amazon Redshift.</p>
              Automated Test Framework:
              Utilizing Selenium, I developed an Automated Test Framework in Python. Structuring modular test scripts, Selenium WebDriver facilitated browser automation for user interactions. Efficient test data management ensured comprehensive coverage. Detailed logging and reporting tracked test execution progress. I ensured cross-browser compatibility, testing across platforms. Seamless integration with CI systems like Jenkins automated test execution, enhancing the development lifecycle. This project streamlined testing, expedited releases, and maintained software quality.</p>
